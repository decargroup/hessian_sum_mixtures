"""
This is an example script showing how to generate measurements using multiple
measurement models that are supposed to run in sequence rather than in parallel.
The example shown here is a transceiver communicating with 3 anchors, where it
can only communicate with one anchor at a time. We therefore loop through the
MeasurementModels to generate a measurement to one anchor at every time instance.
